abstract = {Introduction. Developing an automated diagnostic and therapeutic instrument for treating swallowing disorders requires procedures able to reliably detect and evaluate a swallow. We tested a two-stage detection procedure based on a combined electromyography/bioimpedance (EMBI) measurement system. EMBI is able to detect swallows and distinguish them from similar movements in healthy test subjects. Study Design. The study was planned and conducted as a case-control study (EA 1/019/10, and EA1/160/09, EA1/161/09). Method. The study looked at differences in swallowing parameters in general and in the event of penetration during swallows in healthy subjects and in patients with an oropharyngeal swallowing disorder. A two-stage automated swallow detection procedure which used electromyography (EMG) and bioimpedance (BI) to reliably detect swallows was developed. Results. Statistically significant differences between healthy subjects and patients with a swallowing disorder were found in swallowing parameters previously used to distinguish between swallowing and head movements. Our two-stage algorithm was able to reliably detect swallows (sensitivity = 96.1{\%}, specificity = 97.1{\%}) on the basis of these differences. Discussion. Using a two-stage detection procedure, the EMBI measurement procedure is able to detect and evaluate swallows automatically and reliably. The two procedures (EMBI + swallow detection) could in future form the basis for automated diagnosis and treatment (stimulation) of swallowing disorders.},

abstract = {We evaluated impedance pharyngography (IPG), a new method to assess swallowing function based on changes in the electrical impedance of the neck during swallowing. The electrical impedance of the neck, recorded by the 4-electrode method, changed with the equivalent cross-sectional area of the route of the electric current due to reflex activities of related organs during swallowing. IPG waveforms accurately recorded the swallowing process, therefore. We recommend IPG for assessing swallowing function because we expect IPG to provide the following advantages over conventional diagnostic techniques: it is a quantitative method that allows for the objective assessment of swallowing function; it is a simple procedure that is convenient for the patient and could be used for screening; it is inexpensive and non-invasive, so could be performed repeatedly in situations such as rehabilitation; and it uses highly portable equipment suitable for community use.},

abstract = {Dysphagia has a huge impact on the quality of life. In this contribution, a measurement system is presented which allows an assessment of the swallowing process. Additionally, the system detects aspiration. Basis of the system is a two-channel bioimpedance measurement at the neck which can be extended by an EMG recording from the larynx's musculature. The feasibility of aspiration detection was experimentally demonstrated on an animal model. The proposed measurement may be used in both therapy and diagnosis of dysphagia. Within this contribution the idea of a controlled neuro-prosthesis is outlined.},

abstract = {Background: Bioimpedance analysis has found utility in many fields of medical research, yet instrumentation can be expensive and/or complicated to build. Advancements in electronic component design and equipment allow for simple bioimpedance analysis using equipment now commonly found in an engineering lab, combined with a few components exclusive to impedance analysis. Materials and methods: A modified Howland bridge circuit was designed on a small circuit board with connections for power and bioimpedance probes. A programmable function generator and an oscilloscope were connected to a laptop computer and were tasked to drive and receive data from the circuit. The software then parsed the received data and inserted it into a spreadsheet for subsequent data analysis. The circuit was validated by testing its current output over a range of frequencies and comparing measured values of impedance across a test circuit to expected values. Results: The system was validated over frequencies between 1 and 100 kHz. Maximum fluctuation in current was on the order of micro-Amperes. Similarly, the measured value of impedance in a test circuit followed the pattern of actual impedance over the range of frequencies measured. Conclusions: Contemporary generation electronic measurement equipment provides adequate levels of connectivity and programmability to rapidly measure and record data for bioimpedance research. These components allow for the rapid development of a simple but accurate bioimpedance measurement system that can be assembled by individuals with limited knowledge of electronics or programming. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Interjudge reliability for videofluoroscopic (VFS) swallowing evaluations has been investigated, and results have, for the most part, indicated that reliability is poor. While previous studies are well-designed investigations of interjudge reliability, few reports of intrajudge reliability are available for VFS measures derived from frame-by-frame analysis that clinicians typically employ. The purpose of this study was to examine the inter- and intrajudge reliability of VFS examination measures commonly used to assess swallowing functions. No training to criteria occurred. VFS examinations were conducted on 20 patients who had suffered a stroke within six weeks and had no structural abnormalities or tracheostomies. Three clinical judges served as subjects and rated the VFS examinations from videotape using frame-by-frame analysis. A clinician's repeated review of measures employed in the 20 examinations indicated high intrajudge reliability for a number of measures, suggesting that an experienced clinician may employ consistent standards for rating certain VFS measures across patients and time. These standards appear to vary among clinicians and yield unacceptable interjudge reliability. The need to train clinicians to criteria to improve interjudge reliability is discussed.},

abstract = {The Howland current pump is a popular bioelectrical circuit, useful for delivering precise electrical currents. In applications requiring high precision delivery of alternating current to biological loads, the output impedance of the Howland is a critical figure of merit that limits the precision of the delivered current when the load changes. We explain the minimum operational amplifier requirements to meet a target precision over a wide bandwidth. We also discuss effective compensation strategies for achieving stability without sacrificing high frequency output impedance. A current source suitable for Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) was simulated using a SPICE model, and built to verify stable operation. This current source design had stable output impedance of 3.3 M{\&}{\#}x03A9; up to 200 kHz, which provides 80 dB precision for our EIT application. We conclude by noting the difficulty in measuring the output impedance, and advise verifying the plausibility of measurements against theoretical limitations.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate whether the type of instrumental swallowing examination (Fibreoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) or videofluoroscopy) influences perception of post-swallow pharyngeal residue. DESIGN: Prospective, single-blind assessment of residue from simultaneous videofluoroscopy and FEES recordings. All raters were blind to participant details, to the pairing of the videofluoroscopy and FEES examinations and to the other raters' scores. SETTING: Tertiary specialist ENT teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen adult participants consecutively recruited; seven women and eight men aged between 22 and 73, mean age 53. All participants underwent one FEES examination and one videofluoroscopy examination performed simultaneously. Inclusion criteria: referred to speech and language therapy for assessment of dysphagia. Exclusion criteria: nil by mouth or judged to be at high risk of aspiration. Main outcome measures: The FEES and videofluoroscopy examinations were recorded simultaneously. Fifteen speech and language therapists independently scored pharyngeal residue as none, coating, mild, moderate or severe. All examinations were scored twice by all raters. RESULTS: Intra- and inter-rater agreement were similar for both examinations. There were significant differences between FEES and videofluoroscopy pharyngeal residue severity scores (anova, P {\textless} 0.001). FEES residue scores were consistently higher than videofluoroscopy residue scores. CONCLUSIONS: Pharyngeal residue was consistently perceived to be greater from FEES than from videofluoroscopy. These findings have significant clinical implications as FEES and videofluoroscopy findings are used to judge aspiration risk and to make recommendations for oral intake. Further research is required to examine the impact of FEES and videofluoroscopy examinations on treatment decisions.},
